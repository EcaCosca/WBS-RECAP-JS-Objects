# JavaScript Objects and Spread Operators

This repository contains code examples, documentation links, and discussions from a recent lecture on JavaScript objects, spread operators, and related concepts.

## Lecture Overview

During the lecture, various topics were covered:

### JavaScript Objects

- **What are Objects?**
  - Objects in JavaScript are complex data structures that store collections of key-value pairs.
  
- **What are key-value pairs?**
  - Key-value pairs are associations between keys (names) and values, forming the basic structure of an object. Each key is linked to a specific value.

- **What can an object hold?**
  - Objects can hold various types of data such as strings, numbers, arrays, other objects, and functions.

- **How can I access an object?**
  - Accessing an object's properties can be done using dot notation (`object.property`) or bracket notation (`object['property']`).

- **How can I use destructuring in my code?**
  - Destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows for extracting values from objects and arrays into distinct variables, providing a concise way of working with objects.

### Spread Operator

- **What is the spread operator?**
  - The spread operator (`...`) in JavaScript allows for the expansion of iterable objects like arrays or objects. It enables copying values or properties from one object to another or combining multiple arrays/objects.

- **Usage of the spread operator:**
  - It can be used to clone arrays or objects, merge arrays, concatenate arrays, and simplify function arguments by spreading arrays.

- **Expanding Content:**
  - The spread operator takes an iterable (like an array or string) and expands it into individual elements or characters, making it useful for working with collections of data.
